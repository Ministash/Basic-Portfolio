                Hello! My name is Hunter Henry Haak (Yeah, yeah, I get it. Triple "H") I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. 
                Most of my life I have been obsessed with sports that are a bit out of the ordinary. 
                I have been a hiker my entire life, I was a gymnast for 4, and I have been into indoor rock climbing for the past 10 years. 
                Because of these sports, I have truly developed a love and true connection with the outdoors.
